Omaha has some unusual traits, as it has the most millionaires per capita in the nation, and is also home to billionaire Warren Buffett, one of the world's richest and most famous investors. Conversely, it also has one of the highest rates of African Americans living under the poverty line. It is still quite racially divided, with the affluent west side and Midtown being predominantly white, the south side Latino, and the northeast side African American.

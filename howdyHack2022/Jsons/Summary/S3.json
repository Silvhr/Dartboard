   "Name": "Chicago",
   "Summary": "Chicago is the home of the blues and the truth of jazz, the heart of comedy and the idea of the skyscraper. Here, the age of railroads found its center, and airplanes followed suit. \"Stormy, Husky, Brawling / City of Big Shoulders,\" Chicago is a Heartland boomtown, its ethos defined by urban planner Daniel Burnham's immortal vision: \"Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood.\" It is one of the world's great cities.

{
   "Name": "Los Angeles",
   "Summary": "Frank Lloyd Wright is said to have quipped, \"Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles,\" a quote that has since been repeated both by those who love and hate L.A. The \"City of Angels\" is a city of sharp contrasts, home to people who hail from all parts of the globe and an important center of culture, business, media, and international trade. However, it's most famous for being a major center of the world's television, motion picture, and music industry, which forms the base of the city's status and lures visitors for its show business history and celebrity culture. Visitors are also drawn to Los Angeles for its Mediterranean climate and numerous beaches, which gave birth to California's famed surf culture.",
